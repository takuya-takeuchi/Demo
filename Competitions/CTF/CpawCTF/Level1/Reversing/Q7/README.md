# Q7.[Reversing] Can you execute ?

## How to resolve?

Use 'file` command in linux or OSX.
You will see the following message.

````bash
$ file exec_me
exec_me: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.24, BuildID[sha1]=663a3e0e5a079fddd0de92474688cd6812d3b550, not stripped
````

In other words?
