# SSTI1

## How to resolve?

SSTI is `Server-Side Template Injection`.
Server-side template injection is when an attacker is able to use native template syntax to inject a malicious payload into a template, which is then executed server-side.

If values are evaluated by server-side template engines, etc., based on external input, attacher can invoke what he want to do.

For example, `{{8*6}}` is given.
If server returns `48`, server side uses template engine.
Because server side evaluates and calculate dynamically.
On python, `Jinja2` is popular template engine.

The following value will display file and directories in server side.

````
{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls -l').read()}}
````

And you will find `flag` file.

In other words?
