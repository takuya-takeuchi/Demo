# PIE TIME

## How to resolve?

Cehck [vuln](./vuln) amd [vuln.c](./vuln.c).

````bash
$ checksec --file=vuln
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      Symbols         FORTIFY Fortified       Fortifiable  FILE
Full RELRO      Canary found      NX enabled    PIE enabled     No RPATH   No RUNPATH   78 Symbols     Yes      0               1       vuln
````

We will got flag if we can call `win` function but **PIE (Position-Independent Executables)** is enabled.
We can get address by `objdump` but we can not specify address directly due to PIE.

But main address is given when access to sever.
So we can calculate location of `win` function from distance between main and win functions.

In other words?
