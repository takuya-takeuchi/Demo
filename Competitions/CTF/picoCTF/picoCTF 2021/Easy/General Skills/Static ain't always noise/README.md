# Static ain't always noise

## How to resolve?

Problem says `This BASH script might help!`.
So you can kick script like

````bash
$ ./ltdis.sh static 
Attempting disassembly of static ...
Disassembly successful! Available at: static.ltdis.x86_64.txt
Ripping strings from binary with file offsets...
Any strings found in static have been written to static.ltdis.strings.txt with file offset
````

And you will see 2 text files.
These files may have answer.

In other words?
