This program has 2 methods to resolve.

#### Answer 1

You have chance to input too long character. You may occur buffer overrun. 

#### Answer 2

`printf` does not check whether place holder's count matches argument count.
If argument is nothing inspite of passing `%s`, `printf` will try to access random address to get value.
