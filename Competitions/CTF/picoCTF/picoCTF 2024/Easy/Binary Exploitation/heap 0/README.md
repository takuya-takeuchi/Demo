# heap 0

## How to resolve?

Cehck [chall](./chall) amd [chall.c](./chall.c).

````bash
$ checksec --file=chall
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      Symbols         FORTIFY Fortified       Fortifiable  FILE
Full RELRO      Canary found      NX enabled    PIE enabled     No RPATH   No RUNPATH   78 Symbols     Yes      0               1       chall
````

We will get flag when call `check_win` function after override `safe_var`.
At first, we can get memory address of `save_var` and `input_data`.

````bash
$ nc tethys.picoctf.net 62957

Welcome to heap0!
I put my data on the heap so it should be safe from any tampering.
Since my data isn't on the stack I'll even let you write whatever info you want to the heap, I already took care of using malloc for you.

Heap State:
+-------------+----------------+
[*] Address   ->   Heap Data   
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x5f8be2c6d2b0  ->   pico
+-------------+----------------+
[*]   0x5f8be2c6d2d0  ->   bico
+-------------+----------------+
````

We can get distance `0x20` between `save_var` and `input_data`.

In other words?
